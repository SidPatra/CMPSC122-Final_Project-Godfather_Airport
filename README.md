# CMPSC122-Final_Project-Godfather_Airport
Set up an airport for Don Vito - and decide who lives and who dies.

My Godfather (the Don, Michael Corleone) is the head of a major
corporation that deals with olive oil imports from Sicily, legalized personal
companionship, distilleries, and legal casinos gambling
• His corporation (families) interest span the United States from N.Y. N.J.
Chicago, and Kansas City to name a few.
• Because the Don is a “Family” man and wants to personally talk with the
CEOs of his interests together (and separately- when need be ). For security
reasons he has decided to build an airport that will accommodate both
commercial and business travel
